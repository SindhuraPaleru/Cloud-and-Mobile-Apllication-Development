Creating a Windows Azure Storage account
To use storage operations, you need a Windows Azure storage account. You can create a storage account by following these steps. (You can also create a storage account using the REST API.)
I.	Log into the Windows Azure Management Portal.
II.	In the Home Page choose Create a Resource.
 
III.	Click Storage, then Storage account - blob, file, table, queue.
 
IV.	For Resource Group, choose Create new then provide a name to the Resource Group.
 
V.	In Storage Account Name, type a subdomain name to use in the URI for the storage account. The entry can contain from 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers. This value becomes the host name within the URI that is used to address Blob, Queue, or Table resources for the subscription.

VI.	Choose a Region/Affinity Group in which to locate the storage. If you will be using storage from your Windows Azure application, select the same region where you will deploy your application.
VII.	Choose Performance as Standard.
VIII.	Choose Account Kind as Storage (general purpose v1).
IX.	Optionally, you can enable geo-replication.
X.	Choose Access Tier as Hot.
XI.	Click Review + Create.
 
XII.	Finally click Create.
 
Adding Cloud Storage Account Connection String to Cloud Service Application in Visual Studio
I.	Within the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio, in the Roles folder of your Windows Azure Deployment Project, right-click your web role or worker role and click Properties.
 

 
II.	Click the Settings tab and press the Add Setting button.
 
III.	In the Type drop-down of the new Setting1 entry, choose Connection String.
 
IV.	Click the ... button at the right end of the Setting1 entry. The Create Storage Account Connection String dialog will open.
 
V.	Choose whether you want to target the storage emulator (Windows Azure storage simulated on your local machine) or a storage account in the cloud by entering the credentials manually by choosing Manually Entered Credentials Radio Button or by importing your profile by choosing Your Subscription Radio Button. 
 

VI.	Copy the Account Name and Account Key from Windows Azure Portal Storage Account Dashboard.
 

VII.	Change the entry Name from Setting1 to a friendlier name like SACS. You will reference this connection string later in the code in this guide.
